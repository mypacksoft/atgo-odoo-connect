Free online attendance system for ZKTeco devices, integrated into Odoo HR.

This module connects your Odoo HR with `ATGO Cloud`_, a free attendance
platform that lets your ZKTeco devices stream punches to the cloud over the
internet — no static IP, no port forwarding, no local Windows PC.

Odoo polls ATGO every 5 minutes (outbound), creates ``hr.attendance``
records, and acknowledges them so they aren't fetched twice.

.. _ATGO Cloud: https://atgo.io


Features
========

* Pull attendance logs from ATGO Cloud, create ``hr.attendance``
* Map device PIN to ``hr.employee.barcode``
* Optional employee push from Odoo to ATGO (one-way sync)
* Cron-driven (5-minute default, configurable)
* Fully outbound — no inbound network port required on the Odoo host
* Strips ZKTeco biometric data (USERPIC / FACE / FP / BIODATA) at the
  ATGO edge — never reaches Odoo


Configuration
=============

#. Install the module.
#. Sign up at https://atgo.io and create a workspace.
#. In ATGO portal → Settings → API keys → generate one.
#. In Odoo: **ATGO → Settings**.
#. Fill in *Workspace slug*, *API base URL*
   (default ``https://api.atgo.io``), and the API key.
#. Click **Test connection**. You should see your plan + device count.
#. Cron ``ATGO: pull attendance logs`` runs every 5 minutes by default.

Map employees by setting ``hr.employee.barcode`` to the device PIN
configured on the ZKTeco device. Unmapped PINs are stored in
``atgo.attendance.log`` with state *skipped* so you can fix them later.


Usage
=====

* Manage attendances from Odoo as usual (``hr.attendance``)
* View raw pulled logs under **ATGO → Attendance logs**
* Re-process skipped logs after fixing employee barcodes


Compatibility
=============

This branch targets **Odoo 19.0**. Branches for 16.0, 17.0, 18.0 are
maintained in parallel.
